# Axial Rotor–Stator CFD Analysis

This repository presents a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study of an **axial rotor–stator stage**, focusing on flow interaction, pressure rise, and aerodynamic performance.

## Scope
- Rotor–stator flow interaction
- Velocity triangles and stage aerodynamics
- Pressure and velocity field analysis
- Academic CFD methodology and reporting

## Methods
- Steady RANS approach
- Turbulence modeling as detailed in the report
- Rotor and stator domains with appropriate boundary conditions
- Post-processing of pressure, velocity, and performance metrics

## Files
- `docs/rotor-stator-cfd-report.pdf` — Full CFD analysis report (PDF)

## Notes
This project demonstrates applied turbomachinery aerodynamics and CFD-based analysis for aerospace engineering coursework.
